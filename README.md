  - Order date & time  
  - Pizza category (Veggie, Non-Veg, etc.)  
  - Pizza size (S, M, L, XL)  
  - Total sales value  
  - Ingredients usage  

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Sales distribution across **pizza categories**.  
- Order trends by **pizza size**.  
- Ingredient-level consumption analysis.  
- Seasonal decomposition to understand **trend, seasonality, and residuals**.  

---

## 📈 Forecasting Models  
- **ARIMA & SARIMA** models used for time series forecasting.  
- Seasonal patterns identified to predict **future sales & ingredient requirements**.  
- Residual analysis to check model accuracy.
